## 📚 Usage Patterns

### For GPU Training Projects

```bash
# Reference these files:
1. CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md          # Main entry point
2. training/TRAINING_AGENT_GUIDE.md  # Training workflow
3. training/LLM_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md  # If using LLMs
```

### For Academic Writing Projects

```bash
# Reference these files:
1. CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md          # Main entry point
2. writing/STYLE_GUIDE.md          # Writing principles
3. writing/WRITING_ASSISTANT.md    # Orchestration
4. writing/WRITING_LOOP.md           # Review process
5. Specific agents as needed      # See sections above
```

### For Mixed Projects (Training + Writing Papers)

```bash
# Reference all sections:
1. CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md          # Main entry point
2. This file (FILE_MAP.md)        # Navigate to needed guides
3. training/* for training
4. writing/* for paper writing
```

## 🔗 Integration

**How agents discover this map:**

1. Agent reads `.claude.md` → Points to `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`
2. CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md → References `FILE_MAP.md` for complete guide index
3. Agent finds relevant guide in FILE_MAP.md
4. Agent reads specific guide(s) for detailed instructions

**In practice:**
```bash
cd ~/Research/your-project
cat .claude.md              # Symlinks to agent-docs/CLAUDE.md
                            # CLAUDE.md references FILE_MAP.md
                            # Agent can navigate to any specific guide
```
